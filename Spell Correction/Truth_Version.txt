dear students let us start the first lecture of this course this is basically a online
course so therefore you need to be very clear about what you are going to learn and how
you are going to be evaluated first of all this is a course on phase transformation in
materials and i will be teaching all the lectures and it is a thirty lecture course that means
there will be sixty twenty five minutes lecture and every week will be i suppose to i am not
sure now about four to six lectures so that means about two to three hours of lectures
so myself is professor biswas and i am a faculty member at the department of material science
engineering of iit kanpur so thats the details about me my email address is available on
the screen you can daily write to me whenever you have any serious problems and in addition
to that to handle the course exams and also grading appear answer sheets i know this will
be done online will be taken care by the teaching assistance
so two of my students they will be handling that so they are actually the main ah person
will be handling your questions to my write first one is kushbu kushbu tiwari is my pg
and second one is reshma reshma is also my pg student so they will be handling all your
the questions in the discussion forum obviously they are very difficult and i will also participate
and also they will be handling your question paper and grading so my task will be to deliver
all the lectures and then this will be uploaded in to nptel website so that you can observe
and read or or listen online whatever is whatever way you can think about it
now a days also there is another provision all my lectures whatever i am speaking will
be again taken down or written by some experts so we are in the process of finding out those
experts on my earlier course on phase transformation materials similarly we will do it for you
also so that you dont need to listen you can actually read all this lectures notes so before
that happens we are going to only listen this lectures available on the nptel forum and
also you can ask questions in the discussion forum and so thats about it and there email
address is are given and i have carefully removed the phone numbers because this is
where things become very difficult to handle so if you have any questions you can ask them
ask me also or you can put it on the discussion forum ok you know like any things in life
every course has an objective and this objective has to be very clear before you start the
course
so present course actually will deal with basics of transformations in materials and
as i said in my introduction video already you have seen probably that phase transformation
is everywhere present in the normal whether you are talking about materials ceramics polymers
or you are talking about real life phase transformation is present that how do we deal with phase
transformation that is what you will be taught because thats what is important in your endower
to learn phase transformation so using these three things one is your thermodynamics
then kinetics and some basic aspect of material sands like crystal structures and interfaces
we are going to study various solid to solid and liquid to solid phase transformation as
you know this is our subject and covering that in thirty lectures is not an easy task
so obviously we must be selected we cannot teach you everything and to learn everything
you need to have some basic idea ah what i put it as course pre requisites ok and this
pre requisites are should have preferably should have some basic knowledge on basic
material science that most of the students in methodology or material science normally
have thermodynamics especially with thermodynamics functions and their relationships and then
some idea about phase diagrams and diffusion ok
so ah i have already ah checked on different courses in nptel but by mean by different
person is that there are some courses which are videos some courses which are web some
courses which are massive open online so basic material science is already being taught by
some faculty members thermodynamics is already being available and phase diagram i myself
was develop a course nil just one year back diffusion is also partly taught so therefore
you can actually ah clear your doubts while reading these lecture ok ah this is the full
ah rather all the description of the all the lectures ok i dont know whether everything
is coming in this scheme or not but any way most important thing is that we are going
to talk about some very ah at the beginning where we going to talk give you some idea
about free energy because that is the thermodynamic part of the phase diagram so we will show
you the calculation of delta g of various transformations ok then we will talk about
quad derivative of interfaces interfaces means liquid solids gren gren interface interface
inter phase interfaces this are all parts of thermodynamics
then you have to go in to kinetics thats the nucleation because nucleation is what the
starting point of phase transformations so therefore theorem nucleation homogeneous heterogeneous
nucleation and nucleation on the surfaces grains and even clan corners gen edges every
where it will be dealt with as you know nucleation itself is the subject so there that we must
be very ah you know you have to very careful about what you are going to talk about its
i wont be able to tell you every details of the nucleation but whatever element we will
discuss then we are going to start the first of the phase transformation that is on solidification
as you see here solidification is a liquid to solid phase transformations then we will
talk about growth during different aspects like thermal activated growth interface controlled
growth diffusion controlled growth thats why you need to know as well as coupled growth
and you take to array you take the transformation then we will talk about little bit about transformation
kinetics in terms of different models johnson mehl and avrami models and some amount of
gas thermal phase transformations then we will simply go on to different solid phase
transformations like precipitation recrystallisation martensitics spinodal decompositions and we
talk about isothermal and continuous transformations thats itself will be sufficient enough to
call off thirty lectures ok
so ah this is important that you know what we are going to be taught at the beginning
so that you can prepare yourself so we are going to ah follow exactly the same way things
are given on the right side i have also listed down number of lectures will be spent on each
topic now comes in very important aspects because in a massive open online course you
will be exposed to video lectures or the online lectures you must have some amount of you
know text book knowledge so therefore two important text books which are carried from
our library ah is this first one which is which is here is written on that is phase
transformation in metals and alloys classic text book by d a porter and k e easterling
and the recent edition also has come with a new author are all the problems are solved
mr ah doctor m y sherif this is available in india not very expensive book you can read
that and the other book is written by two of my past colleagues although i have never
met them but though are iit kanpur this book is phase transformations in materials and
by professor a k jena and professor m c chaturvedi both were at iit kanpur
so ah when this books written there there were ah jena was in kanpur ok so this two
books will be a basic text book for the course and anyone any of these books will be good
for you you can by this books or you can actually copy from different libraries in the in the
different parts of the book you can copy from different libraries or if you if you want
you actually even ah you know get by that on different online stores correct so thats
about the basic part of the course i think before i could move on to the next portion
of my ah lecture why the phase transformation is delivered let me tell you you will be given
ah assignments on every week and i think assignments are normally uploaded on thursday and because
monday wednesday monday to wednesday will be exposed to the lectures and after that
you will be i will be ah my t s will be uploading the assignments and you will be given about
one weeks time to complete the assignments because assignments will be online so the
questions will be ah multiple choice type or may be fill fill in the blanks type as
assignment will have a weightage of fifty percent weightage and at the end of this semester
you will be taking an end some exam and we are planning to have it online so far if i
dont change my decisions or something else is happens otherwise it will be online and
that will be having a fifty percent weightage
although ah i am not keeping any pass marks for this course but you can interdentally
consider if you are getting less than about say thirty percent of the marks then you will
not be able to pass this course and those who will be successfully completing this course
by taking exams and getting good marks will be given certification from the nptel as you
know so that way i expect that you will be very serious learner and you will be also
able to solve this problems if incase you have difficulties you can always discuss you
can always use the discussion forums or you can write emails you can always bring it to
the ah instructor all the t s so that we can make it clear to you thats very important
because unless and until you know the things very well you will not be able to answer the
questions now ah in the next few slides i am going to talk about what are the relevance
of phase transformation materials development then why do you study in any course i know
that many of you do not exposed by the instructor in the same way you must have an idea why
you are studying this course what is the need well phase transformation is as i said is
represented environment ok
this slide i have taken from the literature you know thats what i am going to answer to
you why study phase transformation material science ok you know what we are actually we
look material for the application in in any case finally we have to think our application
unless and until this material is applied engineering point of view we dont find any
reason to study scientific point of view one can study so application means we must know
that properties all kinds of properties so there is a physical mechanical electronic
electrical magnetic depending on the applications so property or properties of a material is
are estimated very very rigorously to find an potential applications this is true for
even a new materials when its developed so now question is this properties as i said
mechanical chemical electrical magnetic thermal you can even list on many more properties
of the material depends on structure and thats why actually real problem comes structure
has land scape you can simply say atomic structure atomic structure is the smallest structure
you can think about it atom and nucleus infact that is what dictates most of the properties
are to material but that is not all that is what in to this is what you must know very
clearly thats not all
so structure means it can be atomic structure molecular structure grain structure phase
trans distribution and defects ok so we have basically i have listed down from the bottom
up the atom is smallest theses and then we have grains and other things so you must have
i am stressing again you must have an good idea about this structures to correlate with
the properties because it is important that the properties are primarily dictated by the
structure so if i know the structure i can dictate the properties so you got the correlation
right ah very logically speaking we made materials rather we use processing techniques to make
materials and this processing techniques allow you to control structure processing technique
means what you can start with the liquid and solidify that is what is solidification you
can start with the metal piece deform by rolling forging exclusion whatever different means
so you actually process or you can actually deposit thin film you can actually you surface
treatment techniques many things we do in the real ah now processing of materials they
have a direct connection with this structure
a structure has a direct link with the properties so as you see here these actually are variables
for the processing temperature pressure or stress strain or volume and chemical composition
for the alloys you can change chemical composition by making different alloys so these are my
variables in processing and by applying these variables or combination of variables i generate
or i make materials and manufacture materials and this processing variables controls the
structure and structure controls the properties so therefore these three are linked very clearly
they are linked they are not separate or they are not independent things they are connected
to each other these are the of these three important pillars of material science processing
structure and property but finally where to we look for finally we look for what is known
as performance if you are studying in a course syllabus in a course you are finally evaluated
on performance similarly materials are evaluated in terms of performance if i put a tire in
your car that means the major performance is the tire should be able to drive the take
the car from one place to another without any problems but you know tires should vary
from a some ah are twin tire in the in the foreign countries in the the eyes tire which
will travel on are different
so that means performance indeed are actually connected to all these three things processing
structure and the properties and that is what is important this chart which is very famous
in material science you will find in many books is known as the material tetrahedron
because they are actually looks like a tetrahedron so finally where does the phase transformation
comes it is in the structure we modify the structure we modify the atomic structure we
modify grain structure we modify the various by phase transformation so therefore phase
transformation are directly linked with processing and also indirectly connected with the properties
and thats why it is a very important course in the material science engineering you must
understand that without knowing the or phase transformations you cannot control material
properties ok
so ah phase transformation or phase equilibria or thermodynamics is the basis for understanding
a material response to change in temperature pressure composition i must accept this is
slide i have taken from web this is not mine thus the critical link between processing
and microstructure requires a knowledge of the relevant thermodynamics principles and
they are the basis for phase transformations so you understand now why we are actually
studying the phase transformations ok now question is this can i relate it to real applications
i have taken four applications again i taken from the internet sites first one is in air
plane ok air plane is the very important ah mode of transport from one part of the world
to other part and you know the material which is used in the air plane is an aluminum copper
alloy if you dont know you can actually check on the books this is the classical alloy aluminum
four point five to four point seven percent copper known as dual lumen in the in the trend
name and this is a very stable alloy from forty five degree celsius to minus sixty five
degree celsius or even minus eighty degree celsius i dont know how many of you read news
that there is a research laboratory in the southern hampshire that is in hm antarctica
and sometimes if somebodies yield in the research laboratories in winter time they are actually
taken from that place by plane to the the different country especially in southern america
and such parts but it will be extremely cold minus sixty to minus eighty degree celsius
temperature so a plane flying there the material has to be stand such a low temperature
so this wonderful material which is prepared long back is used for the plane body and important
phase transformation which is happening here is a precipitation of certain phase in aluminum
alloys and this precipitates provide the strength from high to low temperature if you travel
carefully on the planes you will find especially in the wings deviated join and this deviated
joins are very strong and low temperatures because of the precipitation so we are going
to discuss about that ah next one which is very important on the right side is air turbine
basically it can be used in the plane the high speed plane or in when in power generators
and they contained nickel based super alloys this wonderful material this is nickel aluminum
alloy with consisting of many other elements which i will not discuss in detail now but
again the real high temperature properties because this this is turbine so thereforth
this has to be instant high temperature high temperature properties equi based properties
of this material is basically because of precipitation of n i three a l type l one to precipitates
what we known as in a nickel matrix fcc matrix and this unique precipitates actually provide
the strength ok the thats thats that means precipitation is very important aspect to
understand so thats what is will be part of silvers
then on this side left side i know may be your right this is the rails which is used
to as a phi splay on the railway tracks this actually steels basically the steel of perlite
what you known as if you dont have any idea perlites perlite is nothing but a utech transform
product of gamma solution of carbon in iron and so therefore you must you must know how
this transformation happens whether we can control it because the properties of the rail
depends on that and remember rail is is ah what is allow you to allowing us to move trains
so therefore they are they are subjected to stress temperature harsh environment and many
other things so they must have combinations of properties so that they can start the purpose
and these is basically done by controlling the phase transformations on the right side
this is the end the last example is basically the titanium based align engines ok remember
this engines are not used in car they will be used in planes or may be in some other
strategic applications like ah turb hm like the submarines and so
so these engines actually has many plus like titanium valves titanium mmcs springs titanium
mnc cramsups many others things springs and there are titanium aluminites you know titanium
out of these all thirteen m alloys the most important alloy which is extensively used
in titanium sixth aluminum four vanadium and it it we can control the micro structure of
these by many ways creating alpha titanium alpha plus beta titanium beta of titanium
alloys so ah the properties will vary depending on whether its alpha alpha plus beta alpha
or beta remember alpha is hexagonal prospect structure beta is bcc structure so titanium
actually ah room temperature below what to eight hundred eighty two degree celsius temperature
is basically alpha above that it is a this i mean bcc structure so one can actually play
around in the temperature zone by again controlling the prosaic parameters to create different
kinds of structures to get different properties
so all these applications dont think that they are similar alpha alloys or beta alloys
alpha plus beta alloys they can be combination of many of these then the actual real problem
is how do i control this micro structures by controlling the processing parameters so
remember these four examples are not exhausted one can find many many examples in the real
life as i told you in my first introduction lectures the basic example you always find
is in the country india when hot summer days you want to drink cold water so you can always
put the cold water inside the fridge and get it cooled but it is real advantage is that
if i take a glass of water and add a ice cube taken from the deep freezer immediately the
ice cube will start melting it down or getting dissolved in the water both are actually h
two o one is solid h two o and the other is liquid h two o
so therefore by melting it down the heat is getting transferred to the liquid and then
the water gets cool down you will enjoy the drinks so this is the example which is present
which you are actually doing it but what is important you for you to understand how these
transformation happened how these solid become liquid liquid become solid whether is very
simple or no remember what is from the most complex systems in the world and no unlike
metal like more complex so ah let me just stop here before i go to the next part of
the lecture or the next class so you understand in a nutshell that phase transformation is
basically very important from the perspective of material science and technology and many
of these products which you are actually using these their properties are controlled by controlling
phase transformations we can do that by using different processing parameters temperature
stress strain compositions and by doing that we alter them micro structure the atomic structure
and by doing that you will create a different properties so that is the relevance of phase
transformation course and which will be exposed to in the next subsequent lectures
