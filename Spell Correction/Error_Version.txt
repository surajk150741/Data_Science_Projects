the students let us start the first lecture of this course this is basically a anline course so therefore you need to be very clear about what you are going to learn and how yeu are going to be evaluated first of all this is a course on phase transformation in materials and i will be teaching all the lectures and it is a thirty lecture corse that means there will be sixte twenty five minutes lecture and every week w will be exposed to i am not sure now about four to six lectures so that means about two to three hours of lectures so myself is persummiswas and i am a faculty member at the department of material cense engineering opiitianpull so thuts the detals about me my email address is available on the screen you can dialaly write to me whenever you have any serious problems and in addition to that to handle the courseexams and also grading of your answer seets although i know this will be all done all line will be taken care by the teaching assistems so two my students they will be handling that so they are actually the main person who will be handling your questions to my right first one i cospo chospotivaris is my pey student and second one is res pa res mis also my pan i student so they will be handling all your questions in a discussion forum obviously they are very difficult then i will also participate and also they will be handling your question paper and grading so mit ask will be to deliver all the lectures and then this will be uploaded int tan putal website so that you can observe and read or orlition or learn whatever me whatever way you can think about it nowadays also there is another provision all my lectures whatever i am speaking will be again taken down or written by some x parts so we are in the process of finding out those x parts for my earlier course and phase transformation materials similarly weill willl do it for you also so that you do nt need to listen you can actually read all these lectures nones so before that happens you are going to only listen this lectures available on the empetrial form and also you can ask questions in the discussion forum and so that s about it and their imular deses are given and i have carefully removed the phone numbers because this is why things become very difficult to handle so if you have any questions you can ask them ask me also or you can put it on the discussion formok you know like any things in life every course as an objective and this subjective has to be very clear before you start a course sopresent course actually we ill deal with basic surface transformations and materials as i said in in my introduction vadio already you have seen probably that past transformation is everyuler present in the environment whether you are talking about metals ceramics polyments or youare talking about real life whase transformations present but how do we deal is phase transformation that is wha w will be taught because thats what is important in your eneavor to learn phase transformations so using these three things one is your o thermodynamics tin kinetics and some basic aspect of material sensil like cystal structures and interfaces we are going to study various solid o solid an liquid to solid phase transformation as we know this is a vast subject and covering that in thirty lectures is not an easy task so obviously we must be selected we cannot teach you everything and to learn everything you need to have some basic idea what i put it as course perriquicite ok at this peracuosit ar you should have peperabil seuld up some basic knowledge on basicg material science that most of the students in metallurgy or material sanse normally have thermodynnamics especially the thermonynic functions and their relationships and then some idear phase dicoms and diffusion ok so i have already checked on different portions o wa in pteal but y mean wy different person is that there are some corsea video or some costiture wave some couses which are massive open allline so basic meterial sense is already been taught by some fecal numbers thermodynamics has already been available and phase ther ommi manself has develop a course and thenill just one yar back deffision is also piraly taught so therefore you can actually clear your doubts by while reading these lecture ok this is the full whether all the resciption of the all the lectures ok i dowt know whether everything is coming in the schene or not but anyway most important thing is that we are going to talk about some very at the beginning we are going to talk give you some idea about fee eng because that is a therbonanis part of the phase diagram so we will show you the calculation of delta g of various transformations ok then we will talk about quite a bit of interfacces interfaces means liquid sal is solid solid grain grain interface interface interfaeinturfaces these are all parts of with theronynoamics then we have to go into kinetics thats the nuculation because nuclation is why the starting point of phase transformations so therefore theory of necclation howmoteou etegean eculations and nicculation on the surface is grains and even cen corner gen s everywhere it will be dealt with and assume youon ecleasion itself a subject so there therepory must be a very an now we have to be very careful about what you are going to talk about it i wonlt be goilg to tell you every details of the niculation but whatever relevant we will discuss then weu are going to start the first of the fist transfertion that is om solidification as youl see here sitification is an liquid to solid phase transformations then we will talk about growth during different aspects like thermal activated god interface control go efficient control go that's why you need to know and cassil as couple goe then you take toeutectric transformations then we will talk about little bit about transformation kinetics in terms of theeen model con enmel and aromi models and some amount of te thermal phase transformations then we simply go on to different soi to solitla transforsioni presipitations rectliz and matisides spinagtal dey comporitions and a wit about stermaland continuous transformations that itself will be sufficient and ap to cover tatilectures ok so  this is important that you know what you are going to be taught at the beginning so that you can prepare yourself so we are going to follow exactly the same way things are given ond the right side i have also eassted down number of lectures will be spend on each topic now comes in very important aspects because in the massive open allline course you will be exposed to radio lectures or the ali lectures you must have some amount of you know textbook knowledge so therefore two important texbook which i have carried from our libary is this first one which is which is here is written on that is phase transformation in metals and alloys classic textbook by d a porter and k is telling and the retant addition also has come with a new author all the poblems ol solved by mister sductor am srip this is available in india not very expensive book you can read that and the other book is written by two my past colleagues although i have never met them but they are ita anpol this book is pase ransformation is in materials and by propessor ak geni and prome m cso thropey both er i tecanpuo so when these books are written theyare all therwere gena was in conpul ok so these two books will be your basic textbooks for the course and anyone any of these books will be good for you you can buy these books or you can actually cofy from different liabilitin in the different parts of the booksyo can copy from different libraries or if you if you want you can actually even now get buy that on different online stores current so thatis about the basic part of the courseading before i could move onto the next portion ow my lecture why the pac transfer sale wet let me tell you you will be given assignments in every week and i think assermenstion normally uploaded on thursday and because monday wenus t mandayto etness stay will be exposed to the lectures and after that you will be i will be or my t sh willl be uploading the assenments and you will be given bout one wexks time to complete the assignments because assignments olme alline so the questions whould be multiple choice type or may be fieling fill in the blank stipe as a senment wo levo it is a fifty percent vatage and at the end of this semisster you will be taking an nsm exam and we are planning to have it anlline so far if i do not change my decisions or something else happens other isity peall line and that wwill be having a fifty percent vertage although i am not keeping any pass marks fof this course but you can tentitively consider if you are getting less than about say thirty percent of the marks then you will not be able to pass this course and those who will be successfully complating this course by taking examps and getting good marks will be given sadification from the inpetrial as you know so that way i expect that you will be very serious planner and you will be also able to solve thise problems if a in case you have difficulties you can always discuss we can always use discussion for or you can write emails you can always bring it to the instructor all the t s so that we can make it clear to you thats very important because understandly you know the things very well ouwod not be able to answer the questions now in the next few slides i am going to talk about what ar relevant sof face transformation materials eelonment and why do you study in any course i know that many of you do not expose by the instructor in the same way you must have an idea why you are studying this course what is the need well phase transformation assisiol is presented envoroment ok the slide i have taken from literature ou ome that is what i am going to answer to you why study phase transformation material science ok you know what wearin actually we look materials for the application in any case finally we have to think of application uness aantilis materi is applied engineering point of view we do nt find any reason to study stentii qoan to give one can stand so application means we must know the properties all kinds of of part so there is a physical mechanical electronic electrical magnetic depending on the applications so property proparti sola material is are estimated very very regarsly to find and potential applications this is two porbe new material when it is developed so now question is this poparti as i say mechanical chemical electrical minity thermal you can evenly stond miny more propariies of the material depends on structure and thats why actal leral problem come structure has length scale you can simply say atomic structure at min structure is the smallest structure you can think about it atom and nucleus in fact that is why detales one sonle propadisiofto material but that is not all that is what in so this is wha you must know very clear that is not all so structure means it can be atmix structure moleculor structure grain structure phase as distribution and defects ok so we have basically have listed down from the bottom of atom is the smalle species and then we have grains and other things so you must have i am stressing again you mast tem end go a good idea about thes structures to colulate to the properties because it is important that the properties are primarily dictated by this structure so if i know thes taxture i can vector the properties so you got the corelition right a very logically speaking we make materials whether we use processing techniques to make materials and these pocessing techniques allow you to control structure processing techninue means what you can start with he liquid and solidifi that is why the solidification you can start with a metal piece deform by rolling forceea ixtrution whatever deferent means so you actually process or you connectyou deposite tin flame you can actually use surfa statement techniques many things we do in the real app now processing of materials they have a direct connections with a structure and stractor as a direct link with the properties so as you see here these actually are variables for the processing temperature pressure o stress strain or volume and chemical compussion for the aways you can change chemical comparation by making different allays so these are my variables in processing and by applying these variables rcommunation variables i generatemor mi make materials or manufacturing materials and these processing variables control the structure unstructure controlser properties so thers therefore these three are linked very clearly they are linked they are not separate or they are not independent things they are connected to each other t these are the bridges of these three important pillars of material science processing structure an property but finally what we look for finally we look for what is known as performance if yo war you are studying in a co sylamas in a course we are finally a holelotingal performance similarly materials are alated in terms of performance if i put a tyre in our car that means the major performanceis that i should be able to drive the take the car for one place to the place without any problems whut you know tires will varry from a summer to winter in the in the point countries and ice the tires which will travel n ic t are different so that means performance indeed are actually connected to all these three things processing structure and the properties and that is what is important this chart which is very famous in material science youwill find in many books is known as the material statehydron because they i actually looks like it ha tri so finally where does the pise transformation comes it is in the structure we modify the structure we modify the atomic structure wo vontify the grain structural modifie the phasesby phase transformations so therefore phase transformationis a direct link wofh the procession and also indirectly corrected with the properties and thats why it is a very important course in the material ens engineering you must understand that without knowing the phase transformations you cannot control material properties ok so phase transformation phericallibeof thermodynamics is the basis for understanding a material respons to change in temperature pressure composition i must accept this is slide i have taken from way this is not mine thus the cskhetical link between processing and microstructure requires an knowledge of the relevant thermodynamic principles and they are the basis force phase ransformation so you understand now why we are actually studying the phase transformations ok now question is this can i relate in the real applications i have taken four application again ily taken from the internate sites first one is an airplane ok air plane is a very important mode of transport from one part of the wall to the other plant and you know the material which is used in the airplane is an aluminum coper alloy if you do not know you can actually thake on the books there is a classical alloy elevin a four point five to four point seven percent copper known as develumin in the in the trannine and this is a very stable ally from forty five deee celsius to minus sixty five u celso or even minus a t ti cels i don t know how many of you prate new stat there is a desise laboratory in the southern hemissphere that is in antactica and sometimes if somebody is ill in the decised laboratorieis in winter time they are actually taken from that place by plane to termelat the the different content unespecially in southa america or sub parts but it will be extremely cold minus sixthief to minus eighty dege sel system pressures so a plane flying there the meterial has to withstand such a low temperature so ther this one nufe material which is prepared long back is used for the plane body and important phase transformation which happening here is a presipitation of certain phase in aluminum alase and these pecifitates provide the strength from high toonar temperature if you travel carefully on the planes you will find especially in the wings reveted joints and these revated joints are very strong at low temperatures because of the pecifitation so we are going to discuss about that the next one which is very important the right side is a turbine basically it can be used in the plane the high squid plane or inven in pow generators and they contained nickel by supervise is onderful material is a nickel aluminum alloy with consisting of many ou elements which i will not discuss in detail now but again the real high temperature propertiis because this this is a turbine so therefore this has to isstan high temperature high temperature properties cubiastane properties of this material is basically because of presipitation of a i three a type l one to pecipitates what you known as in a nickel mafrix eptrisi matrix and these unique pesipitates actually provide the strength ok the thus that that means the pestipretation is very important aspect to understand so that s why is will be part of a syllivas then on the side left side or you know may be right this is the rails which is used to as a fist plate on the relay tracks these action steels basically ther steel of parallite what do we known as if you do not have any idea of parallytes pinite is nothing but a eu tectortically transform product of gamma solisulation of carbon in iron and so therefore you must we must know how this transformation happens whether can wou control it because the properties of the rail depends on that remember ral is is what is allowing you to alon us to move trains so therefore they are they are subjected to straiss temperature harshhen movement and many other things so they must have combinations of properties so that they can serve the purpose and these is basically done by controlling the phase trans fotions on the right side this is the end the fast example is basically the titanium based ally engines ok remember these engines are not used in car they will be estingused in the planes or maybe in some other statiic applications like ter like the submarines or so so these engines actually has many plaslect itanium balves tha dineam mmc is pins that iamm c cranks ups many other things springs and they are tightina aluminites you know titanium out of thes all thatinamalise the most important allo which is extensively used is thitinium six aluminium pole canadium and it it we can control the marchester of these by mini ways creating alphalatonium also plus beted ditenium metou tatinm alloys so the propertisill vary depending on whether its alpha so plus petal p  meter re alpha is xamo pro spect structure meta is which is in structure so ratinium actually a noom temperature below what to eight hundred eighty two dea cel system presture is basically alpan above there in is n t is aing mec c structure so one can i actually play around in the temperature jone why again controlling the posting parameters to create different kinds of structures to get different properties so all these application dont think that they are all similar alparallits or metalos ofopenit always they can be combination so many of these then the actual real problem is how do i control these microstructures by controlling the prosissing parameters so rember these four examples are not exhaustive one can find many many examples in real life as i told in my first introduction lectures the basic example we always find is in in in country like india in the hot summer day you want to drink cold water so you can always put the quater inside the friige and get it cooled but it is real advantage is that if i take a glass of water and add a ice cube taken from the dee preture imedially the ic squee will start melting it down or getting dissolved in the water both a actually i tw o one is solid i tu or is a liquid isste so therefore by melting it down the heat in getting transfer to the liquid and then the water gets cooled down you enjoy the dring so this is the example which is present which we are actually doing it but what is important nou for you to understand how this transformation happens how the solid become liquid liquid become solid whether is very simple unknown remmer what is one of the most complex systems in the wild i m a unlike metal thes are more complex so let me just stop here before i go to the next part of the lecture or the next class so you understand in a natall that phase transformation is basically very important from the perspectives s of material science and technology and many of these products which you are actually using thes the properties are controlled by controlling phase transformations we can do that by using different pousing parametous temperature stay strain compossions and wy doing that we alter the microstructure the atmix structure and by doing that you are creating different propertiesso that is the relevance of face ansformation course and which you will be exposed to the next subsequent lectures
